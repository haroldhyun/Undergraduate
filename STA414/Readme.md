# STA414 - Statistical Methods for Machine Learning II

**Syllabus**: Probabilistic foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning methods such as naive Bayes, mixture models, and logistic regression. Gradient-based fitting of composite models including neural nets. Exact inference, stochastic variational inference, and Marko chain Monte Carlo. Variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. 

This course introduces commonly used machine learning algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, boosting etc. It will also offer a broad view of model-building and optimization techniques that are based on probabilistic building blocks which will serve as a foundation for more advanced machine learning courses.
