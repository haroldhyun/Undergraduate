# A3 Facial Expression Recognition using Neural Network 
This assignment covers:
- Support Vector Machines (both soft and hard margins)
- Neural Network
- Optimization by analyzing cross-entropy

Files:
- A3_q1 -> Statisitcs behind the model
- A3_q2 submission -> Result/summary from the neural network
- nn.py -> main python script for neural network. Run this file.
- utils.py -> utility functions used in nn.py
