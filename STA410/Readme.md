#STA410 Statistical Computation 

Syllabus: The goal of this course is to give an overview of some of the computational methods that are useful in statistics. The first part of the course will focus on basic
algorithms, such as the Fast Fourier Transform (and related methods) and methods for generating random variables. The second part of the course will focus on numerical methods for
linear algebra and optimization (for example, computing least squares estimates and maximum likelihood estimates). Along the way, you will learn some basic theory of numerical
analysis (computational complexity, convergence rates of algorithms) and you will encounter
some statistical methodology that you may not have seen in other courses.
